## Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray
This project is a deep learning-based application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a pretrained CNN model (VGG16). The application is built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, PyQt5 (GUI), and OpenCV for image processing.

# Features
1.Upload Chest X-ray Image
2.Preprocess and Predict Pneumonia Using CNN Model
3.Voice Output for Prediction
4.User-friendly GUI with PyQt5

# Tech Stack
1.Frontend: PyQt5 (GUI)
2.Backend: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
3.Programming Language: Python
4.Model: Pretrained VGG16 CNN
5.Dataset: Chest X-ray images


# Installation & Setup
1.Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pneumonia-Detection.git  
cd Pneumonia-Detection  
2.Install dependencies
pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python pillow pyqt5 pywin32
3.Run the application

# How It Works
1.Upload X-ray Image: Select an X-ray image from your system.
2.Preprocessing: Resize and normalize the image.
3.Model Prediction: The model predicts whether the X-ray shows Pneumonia or Normal lungs.
4.Result Display: The result is displayed on the GUI with voice output.

# Future Improvements
1.Improve model accuracy with more data
2.Enhance UI for better user experience
3.Deploy as a web-based application
